sky
# first line is the prefix for the filenames; they're hardcoded in. the options are sky, swamp, cave, library.
# remaining lines start with D or T: 
# D means a distance delay (a monster spawns when you have walked that distance) and 
# T means time delay (monster spawns when you've waited that time)
# the second argument is the delay amount; for distance, it's the distance you've walked in units. for time, it's the time in seconds.
# the third argument chooses the type of enemy.
# fourth and fifth indicate the position at which the enemy spawns. Hopefully.
